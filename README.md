Mathematical Tasks Solving Enhancement

MTSE is something I used to call "supercalculator": an interactive calculator able to compute complex arithmetic expressions.

MTSE provides GUI, several operators, built-in functions etc., and **should not** be used in actual computations. It could be a neat school project. As for usage, however...

## Usage
Use Python.
