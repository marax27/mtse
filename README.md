Mathematical Tasks Solving Enhancement

MTSE is something I used to call "supercalculator": an interactive calculator able to compute complex arithmetic expressions.

MTSE provides GUI, several operators, built-in functions etc., and **should not** be used in actual computations. It could be a neat school project. As for usage, however...

## Usage
Use Python.

If you are truly interested, there are 3 .txt files (in Polish) in both gui/bin/Debug/ and gui/bin/Release/str/: list of operators, functions and strings used by an application.
